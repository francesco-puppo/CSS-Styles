# CSS-Styling

## A collection of CSS styles for your browser

I am one of those persons that still likes to customise the websites they visit often. 

Most of the changes I made are aimed at reducing distractions and improving the User Experience.

I only use CSS to style the pages, even if I would like to start learning JS properly, so bear with that.

## How to 

Just copy and paste the CSS style in your preferred browser extension that allows to inject CSS.

I use [Cascadea](https://cascadea.app/) on Safari, and the integrated Boost extension in [Arc](https://arc.net/).
